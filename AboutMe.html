    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a passionate and driven developer who thrives on turning ideas into reality through code. With a strong
        background in web development, I enjoy working on both the creative and technical sides of building
        applications. From crafting clean, responsive, and visually appealing interfaces to designing efficient backend
        systems, I strive to deliver solutions that are not only functional but also engaging for users.

        Over the years, I’ve cultivated a keen eye for design and user experience, which allows me to create
        applications that feel intuitive and enjoyable to interact with. My approach blends creativity with
        problem-solving, ensuring that every project I work on is both innovative and practical.

        I’m constantly exploring new technologies, frameworks, and tools to expand my skill set and stay up to date in
        this ever-evolving field. Whether it’s experimenting with modern frontend libraries, building reliable backend
        systems, or integrating databases to handle complex data, I love the challenge of bringing projects to life from
        start to finish.

        This portfolio highlights some of my work, showcasing my growth, skills, and dedication as a developer. Each
        project reflects my commitment to writing clean code, delivering high-quality results, and pushing myself to
